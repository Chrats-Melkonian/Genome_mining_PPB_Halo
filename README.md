# Microbial Function Analysis for Halophiles and Halotolerants PPBs

## Author
Chrats Melkonian

## Overview
This repository contains an R script used to analyze microbial functions associated with halophilic and halotolerant organisms. The analysis includes dimensionality reduction (UMAP), visualization, data transformation, pathway completeness, and the generation of heatmaps for various fixation types. The code also employs advanced filtering techniques and custom visualization styles for microbial function analysis.

## Requirements
The following R libraries are required for running the script:
- `dplyr`
- `ggplot2`
- `factoextra`
- `ggrepel`
- `uwot`
- `patchwork`
- `tidyr`
- `ggupset`
- `pheatmap`

You can install these libraries using the following command:

```r
install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "factoextra", "ggrepel", "uwot", "patchwork", "tidyr", "ggupset", "pheatmap"))
