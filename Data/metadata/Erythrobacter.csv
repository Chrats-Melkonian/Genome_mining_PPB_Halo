To date, how this human-made environment affects the microbial diversity in the water column and the surrounding areas remains unaddressed. By applying metagenomic assembly and recruitment, we conducted an analysis of samples collected from two depths on marine farms of gilthead seabream cultures (Sparus aurata). This bioproject describes metagenomic datasets from 2 different depths (10 and 20 m deep) and filter sizes (0.22-5 microns - Free Living [FL]; 5-20 microns - Particle attached [PA]. Samples were collected on December 2018 in a mariculture set up close to the coast of Alicante (Spain).

Here we report the cultivation and genomic analyses of sediment microbiota collected from 6477 m depth of the Mariana Trench. The sediment samples were cultured anaerobically in laboratory for four months, before subjected to full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing using the PacBio technique and metagenome sequencing using both the Illumina and Nanopore techniques. The 16S rRNA gene analyses revealed 437 operational taxonomic units that are specific for the cultured microbiota, despite the lower diversity of the cultured microbiota in comparison with the original microbiota. Metagenome analyses revealed the prevalence of functions related to respiration, energy production, and stress response in the cultured microbiota, suggesting these functions may contribute to microbial proliferation under the laboratory condition. Binning of the assembled metagenome contigs generated four nearly complete genomes, affiliated to yet unclassified species under the genera Alcanivorax, Idiomarina, Sulfitobacter, and Erythrobacter, which were enriched in the cultured microbiota but rare or undetectable in the original microbiota. Analyses of the four genomes revealed a variety of genes for carbohydrate utilization and dissimilatory nitrite reduction, pointing to an ability to respire diverse carbon sources using nitrite as the final electron acceptor. Taken together, we showed that coupling culture enrichment and long-read sequencing is probably an ideal way to mine novel microbial species in the hadal environment, particularly the rare species in their native environment niches, and thus expand our understanding of the hadal microbial diversity.","2021-12-25T03:51:40.721Z","2021-12-25T03:51:40.721Z"

This unique example of interspecies hydrogen transfer across habitats creates a niche for an ancient metabolic trait and offers a new perspective in the important role of termites as ecosystem engineers. The remarkable enrichment of hydrogen-oxidising bacteria with high capacity to consume atmospheric hydrogen contrasts the low numbers of methane oxidisers and the limited filtering capacity of mounds to mitigate global termite methane emissions. Hydrogen thus appears to be a preferred substrate that strongly shapes soil microbial communities, which warrants consideration when transferring to a hydrogen-based economy.","2021-03-28T01:47:08.065Z","2021-03-28T01:47:08.065Z"

Each treatment was combined with different solid/liquid culture media (Zobell, R2A, LNHM, etc.), and obtained sequences barcoded by Sanger-sequencing of the 16S. Metabarcoding of the bacterial community was carried out by Illumina 16S-Miseq sequencing of selected cultures.

Despite their considerable spatial scale and the impact they have on the ocean biogeochemical cycles, plume-based studies are scarce. Here we analysed the plume microbial ecology of a deep-sea and a mesopelagic volcano, Brothers and Macauley, on the Kermadec intra-oceanic Arc (South Pacific Ocean). Based on on-board 16S rRNA gene analysis, CARD-FISH, multi-omics approach and an extensive geochemical dataset, we report a SUP05-clade niche differentiation. Niche partitioning was evident in plumes emanating from caldera and the cone of Brothers volcano, potentially owing to the ability of SUP05 to adapt the metabolism to fluctuating environmental conditions. Low-abundant SUP05 was omnipresent, expressing a wide variety of transporters and displaying a heterotrophic lifestyle. Moreover, the mesopelagic plume was dominated by a new SUP05 species, provisionally named Candidatus Thioglobus vadus (CTV), which is found habiting coastal waters. We hypothesise that CTV could be oxidizing iron due to its occupancy of high dFe niches and highly expressed cytochromes. Taken together, we propose that the niche partitioning between SUP05 derives from small variation of environmental parameters and depth across large spatial scales.","2021-08-02T00:08:09.348Z","2021-08-02T00:08:09.348Z"
