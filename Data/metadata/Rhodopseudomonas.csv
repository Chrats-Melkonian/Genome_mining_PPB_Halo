The biofilm was composed of microorganisms involved in the four metabolic processes needed for biogas production. The biofilm proved surprisingly rich in Rhodopseudomonas faecalis, a versatile bacterium able to carry out a photoautotroph metabolism when grown under anaerobic conditions. Our results suggest that this bacterium, able to fix carbon dioxide, could be considered for its use in transparent biogas fermenters in order to contribute to the production of optimized biogas with a higher CH4:CO2 ratio than the biogas produced in regular, opaque digesters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study supporting illuminated bioreactors as a new bioprocess for the obtention of biogas enriched in methane.","2019-07-15T20:32:21.838Z","2019-07-15T20:32:21.838Z"
