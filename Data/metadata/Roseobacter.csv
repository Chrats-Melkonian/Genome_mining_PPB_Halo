These hotspots fuel primary productivity and harbor a diverse consortium of heterotrophs. Interactions with associated microbiota can affect the physiology of Trichodesmium, often in ways that have been predicted to support its growth. Recently, it was found that trimethylamine (TMA), a globally-abundant organic N compound, inhibits N2 fixation in cultures of Trichodesmium without impairing growth rate, suggesting that Trichodesmium receives nitrogen from TMA. In this study, 15N-DNA stable isotope probing (SIP) of a Trichodesmium enrichment was employed to further investigate TMA metabolism and determine if TMA-N is incorporated directly or secondarily via cross-feeding facilitated by microbial associates. We identify two members of the marine Roseobacter clade (MRC) of Alphaproteobacteria as the likely metabolizers of TMA, and provide genomic evidence that they converted TMA into a more readily available form of N, e.g., NH4+, which was subsequently used by Trichodesmium and the rest of the community. The results implicate microbiome-mediated carbon (C) and N transformations in modulating N2 fixation, and thus highlight the involvement of host-associated heterotrophs in global biogeochemical cycling.","2021-06-03T05:47:14.533Z","2021-06-03T05:47:14.533Z"

We sequenced the genome and characterized the physiological properties of a new isolate, strain Lw-13e, affiliated with the genus Pseudooceanicola, showing less than 97% similarity on 16S rRNA gene level to the described Pseudooceanicola species.

With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.","2018-05-26T05:50:15.357Z","2018-05-26T05:50:15.357Z"

It belongs to the Roseobacter clade, a widespread group in pelagic marine ecosystems. Species of the Roseobacter clade are regularly used as models to understand the evolution and physiological adaptability of generalist bacteria. We used gel-free shotgun proteomics to assess E. mobile BBCC367 protein expression under 16 different conditions, including stress factors such as elevated temperature, nutrient limitation, high metal concentration, and UVB exposure. Comparison of the different conditions allowed us not only to retrieve almost 70% of the predicted proteins, but also to define three main protein assemblages: 584 essential core proteins, 2,144 facultative accessory proteins and 355 specific unique proteins. Among these we studied a wide diversity of expressed protein functions, including transporters, DNA repair proteins, quorum sensing, transcriptional/translational regulators, and chemotaxis proteins that provided insights into how RE. mobilis mobile BBCC367 adapts to environmental changes and copes with diverse forms of stress.","2019-02-01T09:41:14.074Z","2019-02-01T09:41:14.074Z"

Roseobacters can account for as much as 25% of the bacterial community in surface waters and have a global distribution. They have been shown to be very important in the global carbon and sulfur cycles. Members of the Roseobacter clade can oxidize carbon monoxide, an important greenhouse gas formed in seawater when sunlight oxidizes marine dissolved organic matter. In addition, roseobacters including Phaeobacter spp. are known to degrade dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) to dimethylsulfide (DMS), which is volatile, and/or converted by demethylation to mercaptopropionate. DMSP is produced by dinoflagellates and prymnesiophytes. Since DMS is involved in cloud nucleation it is evident that the activity of these bacteria directly affects the global climate.

Overall they are able to use a large variety of substrates, produce several secondary metabolites and signalling molecules, and form biofilms. While Phaeobacter spp. have very broad substrate spectra, Leisingera spp. are methylotrophic, i.e. they can grow on a very limited number of methylated substrates. This indicates a specific adaptation which is probably reflected in the genome, possibly by loss of genes coding for specific metabolic pathways.The strains proposed to be sequenced originate from diverse marine habitats (mostly natural surfaces) from all over the world, i.e. tidal flats of the North Sea and the Yellow Sea, marine sediments of the Arctic Ocean and the South China Sea, from a marine electroactive biofilm exposed to natural seawater taken at Genoa, Italy, and from seawater collected from a tide pool off the coast of central California. Some strains of this cluster were found to be associated with higher organisms, such as P. gallaeciensis, which was isolated from rearings and collectors of the scallop Pecten maximus (in Galicia, Spain), and M. algicola, which was isolated from a stationary culture of the toxin-producing marine dinoflagellate Prorocentrum lima (in Vigo, Spain). While most organisms of this group are mesophilic, P. arcticus is a psychrophile.The already sequenced Phaeobacter genomes contain several plasmids which encode genes involved in specific adaptations such as secondary metabolism and biofilm formation. The genome of M. algicola comprises the highest number (10) of plasmids found within the Roseobacter clade. Preliminary experiments (pulsed field gel electrophoresis) with some of the organisms proposed to be sequenced showed that these also contain several plasmids of different size. For P. inhibens and P. daeponensis we detected five plasmids in each organism, while for L. methylohalidivorans only one plasmid was found. ","2014-12-08T22:11:55.980Z","2015-03-16T03:17:09.594Z"

They have been shown to be very important in the global carbon and sulfur cycles. Members of the Roseobacter clade can oxidize carbon monoxide, an important greenhouse gas formed in seawater when sunlight oxidizes marine dissolved organic matter. In addition, roseobacters including Phaeobacter spp. are known to degrade dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) to dimethylsulfide (DMS), which is volatile, and/or converted by demethylation to mercaptopropionate. DMSP is produced by dinoflagellates and prymnesiophytes. Since DMS is involved in cloud nucleation it is evident that the activity of these bacteria directly affects the global climate.
