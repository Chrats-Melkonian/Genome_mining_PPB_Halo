In a PCR tube, millions of clonally barcoded beads are used to uniquely barcode long DNA molecules in an open bulk reaction without dilution and compartmentation. The barcode linked reads are used to successfully assemble genomes ranging from microbes to human. These linked reads also generate mega-base long phased blocks and provide a cost-effective tool for detecting structural variants in the genome.","2020-02-07T13:50:54.571Z","2020-02-07T13:50:54.571Z"
