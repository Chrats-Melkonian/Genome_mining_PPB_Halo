The paucity of reference genomes has limited our ability to interpret skin metagenomic datasets. Here we combine extensive bacterial culturing, deep metagenomic sequencing, pooling of metagenomic datasets, and incorporation of publicly available skin metagenomic datasets to elucidate novel constituents and functions of the human skin microbiome. The resulting Skin Microbial Genome Collection (SMGC) spans 622 prokaryotic species derived from 7,535 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and 251 isolate genomes. This collection includes 174 novel bacterial species and 12 novel bacterial genera providing an increase of 26% in the skin bacterial diversity. Notably, we detected new and abundant members of an uncultured genus, here named Candidatus Pellibacter. We validated the quality of our bacterial MAGs by comparing them to isolates obtained from the same samples. We also recovered 12 eukaryotic species and thousands of viral sequences including novel clades of jumbo phages prevalent in foot sites. With the ability to now classify a median of 85% of skin metagenomic sequences, the SMGC elucidates a new multi-kingdom map of microbes patterning human skin.","2022-10-04T10:57:20.475Z","2022-10-04T10:57:20.475Z"

However, current analogues - meromictic ferruginous lakes - either suffer from light limitation for photoferrotrophy, fix carbon through predominantly sulfurbased photosynthetic pathways, or are located in regions unsuitable for seasonal monitoring. Brownie Lake has sufficient light and an abundant community of anoxygenic phototrophs (including photoferrotrophs), and deeper Canyon Lake has an extended oxic-anoxic transition zone and much lower nutrients than Brownie Lake. Together, these lakes comprise a range of conditions to investigate the controls that varying nutrient levels, physiography, and seasonality have on photoferrotrophic primary productivity and methane cycling. The team will monitor aqueous and carbon isotope geochemistry, microbial community composition, and elemental makeup/mineralogy of particulates from the Brownie and Canyon Lake water columns in order to determine: (1) the physicochemical conditions that regulate the presence and activity of photoferrotrophs, (2) the role of resident microbes in iron and carbon cycling, (3) the inorganic and mineral biosignatures that similar microbial communities might have left in Precambrian iron-rich sediments such as Banded Iron Formations (BIF), and (4) the isotopic imprint of photoferrotrophy and methanogenesis/methanotrophy to carbon and iron cycling.","2020-07-28T12:06:28.673Z","2020-07-28T12:06:28.673Z"

Water samples from two deep horizons (1250 and 1350 m) were taken on 29 March 2018 at the station of the ice camp, located in 7 km from the Listvyanka settlement, with the coordinates 51° 47.244' and 104° 56.346'. Ice thickness in the studied period was 70 cm and depth of the water column at the sampling site was 1405 m. 30 L of water were filtered through the net (size 27-μm) and then filtered through nitrocellulose filters with a pore size of 0.22 μm. DNA was extracted from the 0.22 micron filter (small, planktonic fraction) filter to obtain genomic DNA of the microbial community.","2019-12-31T04:07:37.086Z","2019-12-31T04:07:37.086Z"

Although phototrophic Chloroflexota members use a Type II photosynthetic reaction center, many members also contain chlorosomes, a light-harvesting apparatus only otherwise associated with Type I reaction center-containing phototrophs. Here we report the cultivation of 'Candidatus Chlorohelix allophototropha', a highly novel filamentous anoxygenic phototroph that contains a Type I reaction center and chlorosomes. 'Ca. Chx. allophototropha' represents the first cultured member of a novel order within the Chloroflexota phylum that we have provisionally named the 'Ca. Chloroheliales'. With the cultivation of 'Ca. Chx. allophototropha', the Chloroflexota now represents the only known microbial phylum where both known types of photosynthetic reaction center are utilized separately in members of the phylum.This BioProject contains raw metagenome sequencing reads (generated by the Illumina HiSeq platform with 2x125 base reads) from early enrichment cultures of both 'Ca. Chx. allophototropha' and a second related organism, 'Ca. Chloroheliales L227-5C', which was lost after the first subculture. This BioProject also contains read-cloud metagenome sequencing reads (generated by the Illumina MiSeq platform with 2x150 base reads) representing a later and more highly purified version of the 'Ca. Chx. allophototropha' culture. The read cloud sequencing library was prepared using the TELL-Seq WGS Library Prep Kit. High-completeness and low-contamination genome bins recovered from these metagenomes are also included in the BioProject. Note that only genome bins of the two 'Ca. Chloroheliales' members have been manually curated.","2020-07-28T02:47:02.310Z","2020-07-28T02:47:02.310Z"

The autotrophic growth of nitrate-reducing iron(II)-oxidizing bacteria is rarely investigated and poorly understood. The most prominent model system for this type of studies is enrichment culture KS, which originates from a freshwater sediment in Bremen, Germany. A second NDFO culture, culture BP, was obtained with a sample taken in 2015 at the same pond and cultured in a similar way. To gain insights in the metabolism of nitrate reduction coupled to iron(II) oxidation under in the absence of organic carbon and oxygen limited conditions, we performed metagenomic, metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic analyses of culture BP.This dataset contains: (1) Raw sequencing data of 16S (V4 region, primers 515f and 806r) rRNA amplicon sequencing of the microbial community composition of the autotrophic NRFeOx enrichment culture BP and of environmental samples from the pond where culture BP originates from.
