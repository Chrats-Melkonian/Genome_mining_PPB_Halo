Here we report the cultivation and genomic analyses of sediment microbiota collected from 6477 m depth of the Mariana Trench. The sediment samples were cultured anaerobically in laboratory for four months, before subjected to full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing using the PacBio technique and metagenome sequencing using both the Illumina and Nanopore techniques. The 16S rRNA gene analyses revealed 437 operational taxonomic units that are specific for the cultured microbiota, despite the lower diversity of the cultured microbiota in comparison with the original microbiota. Metagenome analyses revealed the prevalence of functions related to respiration, energy production, and stress response in the cultured microbiota, suggesting these functions may contribute to microbial proliferation under the laboratory condition. Binning of the assembled metagenome contigs generated four nearly complete genomes, affiliated to yet unclassified species under the genera Alcanivorax, Idiomarina, Sulfitobacter, and Erythrobacter, which were enriched in the cultured microbiota but rare or undetectable in the original microbiota. Analyses of the four genomes revealed a variety of genes for carbohydrate utilization and dissimilatory nitrite reduction, pointing to an ability to respire diverse carbon sources using nitrite as the final electron acceptor. Taken together, we showed that coupling culture enrichment and long-read sequencing is probably an ideal way to mine novel microbial species in the hadal environment, particularly the rare species in their native environment niches, and thus expand our understanding of the hadal microbial diversity.","2021-08-26T14:59:07.826Z","2021-08-26T14:59:07.826Z",1

They are aerobic heterotrophic bacteria in the class Alphaproteobacteria, and can also be enriched from natural seawater supplemented with iodide, due to much higher I2 tolerance than the other heterotrophic bacteria in seawater. Recently, iodide-oxidizing bacteria are found to be involved in microbial clogging of well pipes in iodine-producing facilities. Alphaproteobacterium sp. Q-1 was isolated from brine water in Miyazaki, Japan, and was phylogenetically related with a halophilic photosynthetic bacterium Rhodothalassium salexigens with the sequence similarity of 90%.

It belongs to the Roseobacter clade, a widespread group in pelagic marine ecosystems. Species of the Roseobacter clade are regularly used as models to understand the evolution and physiological adaptability of generalist bacteria. We used gel-free shotgun proteomics to assess E. mobile BBCC367 protein expression under 16 different conditions, including stress factors such as elevated temperature, nutrient limitation, high metal concentration, and UVB exposure. Comparison of the different conditions allowed us not only to retrieve almost 70% of the predicted proteins, but also to define three main protein assemblages: 584 essential core proteins, 2,144 facultative accessory proteins and 355 specific unique proteins. Among these we studied a wide diversity of expressed protein functions, including transporters, DNA repair proteins, quorum sensing, transcriptional/translational regulators, and chemotaxis proteins that provided insights into how RE. mobilis mobile BBCC367 adapts to environmental changes and copes with diverse forms of stress.","2019-02-01T09:41:14.074Z","2019-02-01T09:41:14.074Z",2

Furthermore, contaminated wastewater stored in tailings dams may pose an environmental threat through the potential for leakage into local groundwater. Microbial communities are often used for biodegradation and environmental remediation, however, little is known about the membership and metabolic potential of SCN-degrading consortia. Application and improvement of the remediation strategy will benefit from an understanding of organisms that can contribute to the breakdown of SCN- into sulfur, carbon and nitrogen compounds. To this end, we performed metagenomic analysis of samples from two laboratory-scale bioreactors used to study SCN- and CN- degradation by established microbial consortia. Community analysis revealed the dominance of Thiobacillus spp. whose genomes harbor a previously unreported operon for SCN- degradation. Metabolic predictions suggest that a large portion of each bioreactor community is autotrophic, relying not on molasses in reactor feed, but using energy gained from oxidation of the sulfur compounds produced during SCN- degradation. Heterotrophs compose a smaller portion of the reactor bacterial community, and predation by phage and eukaryotes is predicted to affect community dynamics. Furthermore, genes for ammonium oxidation and denitrification were detected, possibly allowing removal of nitrogen as required for complete remediation of wastewater. These findings suggest possible optimization strategies for reactor design such as improved aerobic/anaerobic partitioning and elimination of organic carbon from reactor feed.;derived from metagenome","2016-11-16T04:56:33.676Z","2016-11-16T04:56:33.676Z",136

Here we report the cultivation and genomic analyses of sediment microbiota collected from 6477 m depth of the Mariana Trench. The sediment samples were cultured anaerobically in laboratory for four months, before subjected to full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing using the PacBio technique and metagenome sequencing using both the Illumina and Nanopore techniques. The 16S rRNA gene analyses revealed 437 operational taxonomic units that are specific for the cultured microbiota, despite the lower diversity of the cultured microbiota in comparison with the original microbiota. Metagenome analyses revealed the prevalence of functions related to respiration, energy production, and stress response in the cultured microbiota, suggesting these functions may contribute to microbial proliferation under the laboratory condition. Binning of the assembled metagenome contigs generated four nearly complete genomes, affiliated to yet unclassified species under the genera Alcanivorax, Idiomarina, Sulfitobacter, and Erythrobacter, which were enriched in the cultured microbiota but rare or undetectable in the original microbiota. Analyses of the four genomes revealed a variety of genes for carbohydrate utilization and dissimilatory nitrite reduction, pointing to an ability to respire diverse carbon sources using nitrite as the final electron acceptor. Taken together, we showed that coupling culture enrichment and long-read sequencing is probably an ideal way to mine novel microbial species in the hadal environment, particularly the rare species in their native environment niches, and thus expand our understanding of the hadal microbial diversity.","2021-12-25T03:51:40.721Z","2021-12-25T03:51:40.721Z",6

Here we report the cultivation and genomic analyses of sediment microbiota collected from 6477 m depth of the Mariana Trench. The sediment samples were cultured anaerobically in laboratory for four months, before subjected to full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing using the PacBio technique and metagenome sequencing using both the Illumina and Nanopore techniques. The 16S rRNA gene analyses revealed 437 operational taxonomic units that are specific for the cultured microbiota, despite the lower diversity of the cultured microbiota in comparison with the original microbiota. Metagenome analyses revealed the prevalence of functions related to respiration, energy production, and stress response in the cultured microbiota, suggesting these functions may contribute to microbial proliferation under the laboratory condition. Binning of the assembled metagenome contigs generated four nearly complete genomes, affiliated to yet unclassified species under the genera Alcanivorax, Idiomarina, Sulfitobacter, and Erythrobacter, which were enriched in the cultured microbiota but rare or undetectable in the original microbiota. Analyses of the four genomes revealed a variety of genes for carbohydrate utilization and dissimilatory nitrite reduction, pointing to an ability to respire diverse carbon sources using nitrite as the final electron acceptor. Taken together, we showed that coupling culture enrichment and long-read sequencing is probably an ideal way to mine novel microbial species in the hadal environment, particularly the rare species in their native environment niches, and thus expand our understanding of the hadal microbial diversity.","2021-08-26T14:55:48.091Z","2021-08-26T14:55:48.091Z",1

They have been shown to be very important in the global carbon and sulfur cycles. Members of the Roseobacter clade can oxidize carbon monoxide, an important greenhouse gas formed in seawater when sunlight oxidizes marine dissolved organic matter. In addition, roseobacters including Phaeobacter spp. are known to degrade dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) to dimethylsulfide (DMS), which is volatile, and/or converted by demethylation to mercaptopropionate. DMSP is produced by dinoflagellates and prymnesiophytes. Since DMS is involved in cloud nucleation it is evident that the activity of these bacteria directly affects the global climate.","2014-12-08T22:11:55.969Z","2015-03-16T03:17:09.594Z",15

This indicates a specific adaptation which is probably reflected in the genome, possibly by loss of genes coding for specific metabolic pathways.The strains proposed to be sequenced originate from diverse marine habitats (mostly natural surfaces) from all over the world, i.e. tidal flats of the North Sea and the Yellow Sea, marine sediments of the Arctic Ocean and the South China Sea, from a marine electroactive biofilm exposed to natural seawater taken at Genoa, Italy, and from seawater collected from a tide pool off the coast of central California. Some strains of this cluster were found to be associated with higher organisms, such as P. gallaeciensis, which was isolated from rearings and collectors of the scallop Pecten maximus (in Galicia, Spain), and M. algicola, which was isolated from a stationary culture of the toxin-producing marine dinoflagellate Prorocentrum lima (in Vigo, Spain). While most organisms of this group are mesophilic, P. arcticus is a psychrophile.The already sequenced Phaeobacter genomes contain several plasmids which encode genes involved in specific adaptations such as secondary metabolism and biofilm formation. The genome of M. algicola comprises the highest number (10) of plasmids found within the Roseobacter clade. Preliminary experiments (pulsed field gel electrophoresis) with some of the organisms proposed to be sequenced showed that these also contain several plasmids of different size. For P. inhibens and P. daeponensis we detected five plasmids in each organism, while for L. methylohalidivorans only one plasmid was found.","2014-12-08T22:11:55.980Z","2015-03-16T03:17:09.594Z",1

Roseobacters can account for as much as 25% of the bacterial community in surface waters and have a global distribution. They have been shown to be very important in the global carbon and sulfur cycles. Members of the Roseobacter clade can oxidize carbon monoxide, an important greenhouse gas formed in seawater when sunlight oxidizes marine dissolved organic matter. In addition, roseobacters including Phaeobacter spp. are known to degrade dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) to dimethylsulfide (DMS), which is volatile, and/or converted by demethylation to mercaptopropionate. DMSP is produced by dinoflagellates and prymnesiophytes. Since DMS is involved in cloud nucleation it is evident that the activity of these bacteria directly affects the global climate.","2014-12-08T22:11:55.991Z","2015-03-16T03:17:09.594Z",30

They have been shown to be very important in the global carbon and sulfur cycles. Members of the Roseobacter clade can oxidize carbon monoxide, an important greenhouse gas formed in seawater when sunlight oxidizes marine dissolved organic matter. In addition, roseobacters including Phaeobacter spp. are known to degrade dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) to dimethylsulfide (DMS), which is volatile, and/or converted by demethylation to mercaptopropionate. DMSP is produced by dinoflagellates and prymnesiophytes. Since DMS is involved in cloud nucleation it is evident that the activity of these bacteria directly affects the global climate.","2014-12-08T22:12:32.036Z","2015-03-16T03:17:09.594Z",8

The biochemical mechanisms underlying their interactions become increasingly known, but whether these ubiquitous interdomain interactions may drive bacterial evolution has not been illustrated. To test this hypothesis, we sought to determine the population structure of roseobacters colonizing the phycospheres of coexisting microalgal cells. A few environmental factors including nutrient availability, interactions with phages and phytoplankton are known to drive roseobacter population differentiation. To single out diatoms from other confounding factors that may drive roseobacter evolution, populations associated with diatoms sampled from a single seawater sample were analyzed.","2021-02-27T18:10:11.764Z","2021-02-27T18:10:11.764Z",35

By applying metagenomic assembly and recruitment, we conducted an analysis of samples collected from two depths on marine farms of gilthead seabream cultures (Sparus aurata). This bioproject describes metagenomic datasets from 2 different depths (10 and 20 m deep) and filter sizes (0.22-5 microns - Free Living [FL]; 5-20 microns - Particle attached [PA]. Samples were collected on December 2018 in a mariculture set up close to the coast of Alicante (Spain).

Current long read sequencing technologies can provide valuable long-range information but at a high cost with low accuracy and high DNA input requirement. We developed a single tube Transposase Enzyme Linked Long-read Sequencing (TELL-Seq) technology which enables a relatively low cost, high accuracy and high throughput short read next generation sequencer to routinely generate over 100 Kb long range sequencing information using as low as 0.1 ng input material. In a PCR tube, millions of clonally barcoded beads are used to uniquely barcode long DNA molecules in an open bulk reaction without dilution and compartmentation. The barcode linked reads are used to successfully assemble genomes ranging from microbes to human. These linked reads also generate mega-base long phased blocks and provide a cost-effective tool for detecting structural variants in the genome.","2020-02-07T13:50:54.571Z","2020-02-07T13:50:54.571Z",266

However, current analogues - meromictic ferruginous lakes - either suffer from light limitation for photoferrotrophy, fix carbon through predominantly sulfurbased photosynthetic pathways, or are located in regions unsuitable for seasonal monitoring. Brownie Lake has sufficient light and an abundant community of anoxygenic phototrophs (including photoferrotrophs), and deeper Canyon Lake has an extended oxic-anoxic transition zone and much lower nutrients than Brownie Lake. Together, these lakes comprise a range of conditions to investigate the controls that varying nutrient levels, physiography, and seasonality have on photoferrotrophic primary productivity and methane cycling. The team will monitor aqueous and carbon isotope geochemistry, microbial community composition, and elemental makeup/mineralogy of particulates from the Brownie and Canyon Lake water columns in order to determine: (1) the physicochemical conditions that regulate the presence and activity of photoferrotrophs, (2) the role of resident microbes in iron and carbon cycling, (3) the inorganic and mineral biosignatures that similar microbial communities might have left in Precambrian iron-rich sediments such as Banded Iron Formations (BIF), and (4) the isotopic imprint of photoferrotrophy and methanogenesis/methanotrophy to carbon and iron cycling.","2020-07-28T12:06:28.673Z","2020-07-28T12:06:28.673Z",15

Water samples from two deep horizons (1250 and 1350 m) were taken on 29 March 2018 at the station of the ice camp, located in 7 km from the Listvyanka settlement, with the coordinates 51Ã‚Â° 47.244' and 104Ã‚Â° 56.346'. Ice thickness in the studied period was 70 cm and depth of the water column at the sampling site was 1405 m. 30 L of water were filtered through the net (size 27-ÃŽÂ¼m) and then filtered through nitrocellulose filters with a pore size of 0.22 ÃŽÂ¼m. DNA was extracted from the 0.22 micron filter (small, planktonic fraction) filter to obtain genomic DNA of the microbial community.","2019-12-31T04:07:37.086Z","2019-12-31T04:07:37.086Z",190

The autotrophic growth of nitrate-reducing iron(II)-oxidizing bacteria is rarely investigated and poorly understood. The most prominent model system for this type of studies is enrichment culture KS, which originates from a freshwater sediment in Bremen, Germany. A second NDFO culture, culture BP, was obtained with a sample taken in 2015 at the same pond and cultured in a similar way. To gain insights in the metabolism of nitrate reduction coupled to iron(II) oxidation under in the absence of organic carbon and oxygen limited conditions, we performed metagenomic, metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic analyses of culture BP.This dataset contains: (1) Raw sequencing data of 16S (V4 region, primers 515f and 806r) rRNA amplicon sequencing of the microbial community composition of the autotrophic NRFeOx enrichment culture BP and of environmental samples from the pond where culture BP originates from. Illumina MiSeq sequencing (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) using PE 250 bp MiSeq Reagent Kit v2 (500 cycles kit) were performed at Microsynth AG (Balgach, Switzerland). (2) Raw sequencing data of near full-length 16S (primers 27F and 1492R) sequenced with PacBio Sequel SMRT at the Helmholtz research institute, Munich, Germany. (3) Raw sequencing data of shotgun metagenomics. Library was prepared with TruSeq DNA PCR-Free Kit (Illumina) and sequenced with PE 150 bp on a NovaSeq 6000 totalling 91 Gbp by CeGaT, Tuebingen, Germany. (4) Short reads were assembled with MEGAHIT v1.2.7 using https://github.com/nf-core/mag v1.0.0. (5) Raw sequencing data of shotgun metatranscriptomes (2 conditions, triplicates). Library preparation including bacterial ribodepletion (Illumina Stranded Total RNA Prep with Ribo-Zero Plus kit) and Illumina NextSeq v2.5 sequencing with PE 75 bp and 6 to 53 Mio clusters per sample were performed by Microsynth AG (Balgach, Switzerland).","2021-08-26T15:21:13.502Z","2021-08-26T15:21:13.502Z",14

Although phototrophic Chloroflexota members use a Type II photosynthetic reaction center, many members also contain chlorosomes, a light-harvesting apparatus only otherwise associated with Type I reaction center-containing phototrophs. Here we report the cultivation of 'Candidatus Chlorohelix allophototropha', a highly novel filamentous anoxygenic phototroph that contains a Type I reaction center and chlorosomes. 'Ca. Chx. allophototropha' represents the first cultured member of a novel order within the Chloroflexota phylum that we have provisionally named the 'Ca. Chloroheliales'. With the cultivation of 'Ca. Chx. allophototropha', the Chloroflexota now represents the only known microbial phylum where both known types of photosynthetic reaction center are utilized separately in members of the phylum.This BioProject contains raw metagenome sequencing reads (generated by the Illumina HiSeq platform with 2x125 base reads) from early enrichment cultures of both 'Ca. Chx. allophototropha' and a second related organism, 'Ca. Chloroheliales L227-5C', which was lost after the first subculture. This BioProject also contains read-cloud metagenome sequencing reads (generated by the Illumina MiSeq platform with 2x150 base reads) representing a later and more highly purified version of the 'Ca. Chx. allophototropha' culture. The read cloud sequencing library was prepared using the TELL-Seq WGS Library Prep Kit. High-completeness and low-contamination genome bins recovered from these metagenomes are also included in the BioProject. Note that only genome bins of the two 'Ca. Chloroheliales' members have been manually curated.","2020-07-28T02:46:53.827Z","2020-07-28T02:46:53.827Z",89

Therefore, little is known about the effect of light on microbial communities operating in anaerobic digesters. In the present work, we have studied through 16S rRNA gene amplicon Nanopore sequencing and shotgun metagenomic sequencing the taxonomic and functional structure of the microbial community forming a biofilm on the inner wall of a lab-scale transparent anaerobic biodigester illuminated with natural sunlight. The biofilm was composed of microorganisms involved in the four metabolic processes needed for biogas production. The biofilm proved surprisingly rich in Rhodopseudomonas faecalis, a versatile bacterium able to carry out a photoautotroph metabolism when grown under anaerobic conditions. Our results suggest that this bacterium, able to fix carbon dioxide, could be considered for its use in transparent biogas fermenters in order to contribute to the production of optimized biogas with a higher CH4:CO2 ratio than the biogas produced in regular, opaque digesters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study supporting illuminated bioreactors as a new bioprocess for the obtention of biogas enriched in methane.","2019-07-15T20:32:21.838Z","2019-07-15T20:32:21.838Z",119

Here we report the cultivation of 'Candidatus Chlorohelix allophototropha', a highly novel filamentous anoxygenic phototroph that contains a Type I reaction center and chlorosomes. 'Ca. Chx. allophototropha' represents the first cultured member of a novel order within the Chloroflexota phylum that we have provisionally named the 'Ca. Chloroheliales'. With the cultivation of 'Ca. Chx. allophototropha', the Chloroflexota now represents the only known microbial phylum where both known types of photosynthetic reaction center are utilized separately in members of the phylum.This BioProject contains raw metagenome sequencing reads (generated by the Illumina HiSeq platform with 2x125 base reads) from early enrichment cultures of both 'Ca. Chx. allophototropha' and a second related organism, 'Ca. Chloroheliales L227-5C', which was lost after the first subculture. This BioProject also contains read-cloud metagenome sequencing reads (generated by the Illumina MiSeq platform with 2x150 base reads) representing a later and more highly purified version of the 'Ca. Chx. allophototropha' culture. The read cloud sequencing library was prepared using the TELL-Seq WGS Library Prep Kit. High-completeness and low-contamination genome bins recovered from these metagenomes are also included in the BioProject. Note that only genome bins of the two 'Ca. Chloroheliales' members have been manually curated.","2020-07-28T02:51:59.440Z","2020-07-28T02:51:59.440Z",34

The DNA was fragmented by kinetic shearing, and three shotgun libraries were generated: small and medium insert libraries in pOTWI3 (using size fractions of 2-3 kb and 6-8 kb, respectively), and a large insert fosmid library in pEpiFOS-5 (insert sizes ranging from 28-47 kb), which was used as a scaffold. The relative amount of sequence coverage obtained from the small, medium, and large insert libraries was 8X, 1X, and 1X, respectively. The whole genome sequence was established from 55,081 end sequences (giving 9.6X coverage) derived from these libraries using dye terminator chemistry on ABI 3730xl automated sequencers.The aerobic phototrophic bacteria are ubiquitous as plant symbionts, free-living in lakes and ocean surface waters, soils and even near deep sea hydrothermal vents. In fact, ~10% of all microorganisms in marine surface water samples appear to be aerobic phototrophic bacteria, suggesting a significant contribution to the global carbon cycle. Although the numbers of aerobic phototrophic bacteria vary with locale (Goericke, 2002), it is clear that these organisms are a previously unrecognized major component of the bacterial biomass on Earth. The genome sequence of this representative aerobic phototrophic bacteria species will enable discovery in the following three areas: 1) the evolutionary genesis of photosynthesis genes; 2) pathways of carbon dioxide fixation and production;  3) light and oxygen signal transduction in gene expression.Goericke R (2002) Bacteriochlorophyll a in the ocean: Is anoxygenic bacterial photosynthesis important?

With funding support from FDAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome.

Furthermore, contaminated wastewater stored in tailings dams may pose an environmental threat through the potential for leakage into local groundwater. Microbial communities are often used for biodegradation and environmental remediation, however, little is known about the membership and metabolic potential of SCN-degrading consortia. Application and improvement of the remediation strategy will benefit from an understanding of organisms that can contribute to the breakdown of SCN- into sulfur, carbon and nitrogen compounds. To this end, we performed metagenomic analysis of samples from two laboratory-scale bioreactors used to study SCN- and CN- degradation by established microbial consortia. Community analysis revealed the dominance of Thiobacillus spp. whose genomes harbor a previously unreported operon for SCN- degradation. Metabolic predictions suggest that a large portion of each bioreactor community is autotrophic, relying not on molasses in reactor feed, but using energy gained from oxidation of the sulfur compounds produced during SCN- degradation. Heterotrophs compose a smaller portion of the reactor bacterial community, and predation by phage and eukaryotes is predicted to affect community dynamics. Furthermore, genes for ammonium oxidation and denitrification were detected, possibly allowing removal of nitrogen as required for complete remediation of wastewater. These findings suggest possible optimization strategies for reactor design such as improved aerobic/anaerobic partitioning and elimination of organic carbon from reactor feed.;derived from metagenome","2016-11-16T07:04:03.557Z","2016-11-16T07:04:03.557Z",43

The data and diagnostic tools collected in ANTIRES contribute to a better understanding of the distribution pathways and seasonal dynamics of antibiotic resistance in water bodies and are therefore essential for the development of strategies to contain this process.","2021-04-25T23:47:45.693Z","2021-04-25T23:47:45.693Z",241

In parallel, we are using cultivation-independent methods, including DNA-stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP), using labelled isoprene, to retrieve sequence data of active organisms that may be resistant to laboratory cultivation. Labelled DNA from DNA-SIP experiments is used for amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA and metabolically functional genes, which provides phylogenetic information on active isoprene degraders. In addition, metagenome sequencing of labelled DNA and genome assembly and reconstruction allows us to identify novel genes or pathways used by isoprene degraders.","2019-07-17T14:59:23.011Z","2019-07-17T14:59:23.011Z",189

Therefore, little is known about the effect of light on microbial communities operating in anaerobic digesters. In the present work, we have studied through 16S rRNA gene amplicon Nanopore sequencing and shotgun metagenomic sequencing the taxonomic and functional structure of the microbial community forming a biofilm on the inner wall of a lab-scale transparent anaerobic biodigester illuminated with natural sunlight. The biofilm was composed of microorganisms involved in the four metabolic processes needed for biogas production. The biofilm proved surprisingly rich in Rhodopseudomonas faecalis, a versatile bacterium able to carry out a photoautotroph metabolism when grown under anaerobic conditions. Our results suggest that this bacterium, able to fix carbon dioxide, could be considered for its use in transparent biogas fermenters in order to contribute to the production of optimized biogas with a higher CH4:CO2 ratio than the biogas produced in regular, opaque digesters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study supporting illuminated bioreactors as a new bioprocess for the obtention of biogas enriched in methane.","2019-07-20T02:41:07.183Z","2019-07-20T02:41:07.183Z",270

Here we report the cultivation and genomic analyses of sediment microbiota collected from 6477 m depth of the Mariana Trench. The sediment samples were cultured anaerobically in laboratory for four months, before subjected to full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing using the PacBio technique and metagenome sequencing using both the Illumina and Nanopore techniques. The 16S rRNA gene analyses revealed 437 operational taxonomic units that are specific for the cultured microbiota, despite the lower diversity of the cultured microbiota in comparison with the original microbiota. Metagenome analyses revealed the prevalence of functions related to respiration, energy production, and stress response in the cultured microbiota, suggesting these functions may contribute to microbial proliferation under the laboratory condition. Binning of the assembled metagenome contigs generated four nearly complete genomes, affiliated to yet unclassified species under the genera Alcanivorax, Idiomarina, Sulfitobacter, and Erythrobacter, which were enriched in the cultured microbiota but rare or undetectable in the original microbiota. Analyses of the four genomes revealed a variety of genes for carbohydrate utilization and dissimilatory nitrite reduction, pointing to an ability to respire diverse carbon sources using nitrite as the final electron acceptor. Taken together, we showed that coupling culture enrichment and long-read sequencing is probably an ideal way to mine novel microbial species in the hadal environment, particularly the rare species in their native environment niches, and thus expand our understanding of the hadal microbial diversity.","2021-12-25T03:51:38.466Z","2021-12-25T03:51:38.466Z",5

We now sequenced the genome of Thiospirillum jenense DSM 216, type strain.

These hotspots fuel primary productivity and harbor a diverse consortium of heterotrophs. Interactions with associated microbiota can affect the physiology of Trichodesmium, often in ways that have been predicted to support its growth. Recently, it was found that trimethylamine (TMA), a globally-abundant organic N compound, inhibits N2 fixation in cultures of Trichodesmium without impairing growth rate, suggesting that Trichodesmium receives nitrogen from TMA. In this study, 15N-DNA stable isotope probing (SIP) of a Trichodesmium enrichment was employed to further investigate TMA metabolism and determine if TMA-N is incorporated directly or secondarily via cross-feeding facilitated by microbial associates. We identify two members of the marine Roseobacter clade (MRC) of Alphaproteobacteria as the likely metabolizers of TMA, and provide genomic evidence that they converted TMA into a more readily available form of N, e.g., NH4+, which was subsequently used by Trichodesmium and the rest of the community. The results implicate microbiome-mediated carbon (C) and N transformations in modulating N2 fixation, and thus highlight the involvement of host-associated heterotrophs in global biogeochemical cycling.","2021-06-03T05:47:14.533Z","2021-06-03T05:47:14.533Z",241

The paucity of reference genomes has limited our ability to interpret skin metagenomic datasets. Here we combine extensive bacterial culturing, deep metagenomic sequencing, pooling of metagenomic datasets, and incorporation of publicly available skin metagenomic datasets to elucidate novel constituents and functions of the human skin microbiome. The resulting Skin Microbial Genome Collection (SMGC) spans 622 prokaryotic species derived from 7,535 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and 251 isolate genomes. This collection includes 174 novel bacterial species and 12 novel bacterial genera providing an increase of 26% in the skin bacterial diversity. Notably, we detected new and abundant members of an uncultured genus, here named Candidatus Pellibacter. We validated the quality of our bacterial MAGs by comparing them to isolates obtained from the same samples. We also recovered 12 eukaryotic species and thousands of viral sequences including novel clades of jumbo phages prevalent in foot sites. With the ability to now classify a median of 85% of skin metagenomic sequences, the SMGC elucidates a new multi-kingdom map of microbes patterning human skin.","2022-10-04T10:57:20.475Z","2022-10-04T10:57:20.475Z",71
